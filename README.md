# Tie-Wrap Anchor for Twisted Shoelace

## Introduction

The Tie-Wrap Anchor for Twisted Shoelace (TWATS) is an alternative to shoelace knots.

With TWATS, instead of tying a shoelace knot, you grab the anchor, pull, twist until the desired tightness is reached, and then secure the anchor in place by hooking it onto a small tie-wrap that's looped through two eyelets.

On e.g. Craftcloud, you can print a pair of Carbon Fiber PETG TWATS for ~5 EUR + shipping.

## Features

- very compact package when tied, no loose ends or loops
- even when untied, still no loose ends or big loops, so shoe can be used as slipper
- once tied, tightness can be adjusted in a second or two, with one hand
- torque combined with snug hook fit keeps anchor in place
- symmetric design enables twist adjustment in 180° steps

## Prerequisites

- thick shoelaces, e.g. 550 paracord (thin shoelaces don't twist very well)
- very small tie-wraps (≤ 2.5mm wide)
- OpenSCAD
